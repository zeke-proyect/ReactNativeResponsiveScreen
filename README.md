# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This is a small React Native project that shows how to build a responsive screen for both mobile phones and tablets.
It includes:

orientation detection (portrait / landscape)

tablet detection

a flexible layout that adapts to screen size

a simple grid that changes the number of columns depending on the device

this is very basic 

# Note: 
This project still needs some adjustments, such as making the item boxes smaller on mobile screens. It is only intended as a simple example to show how to create a responsive grid layout in React Native.
